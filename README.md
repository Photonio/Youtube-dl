# Youtube-dl
# Problem:
## cause:
>@dirkf the reason why yt-dlp works is because yt-dlp has abandoned the WEB client entirely. The potoken experiment rate has reached 100% for WEB / rollout is complete. TVHTML5_SIMPLY_EMBEDDED_PLAYER is reportedly the next victim, and I don't think we are currently able to detect the potoken requirement for that client
